This is a Zork inspired text adventure game built using C++ and QT designer.
This project was done for the Event Driven Programming module where we were tasked with making a Zork inspired game from scratch
using C++ and QT.
The main Interesting feature in this is the randomly generated mob and item spawns ensuring each play-through is different giving the player a 
rouge-lite experience.
